# path of your Service Account's JSON file.
# for example if it was inside **utils** folder you should add it like this:
# "utils/google_service_account-steady-scope-436117-p2-f407b01106c9.json"
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_FILE="google_service_account-arctic-diode-438812-b5-7338724a2dea.json"


# This variable is mostly used for deployable apps such as Vercel, Heroku app, etc
# Note: Vercel env variables cannot contain newlines, so you need to remove them from the JSON object
# If GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_FILE and GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS are defined, GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS will take the priority
# Add into this variable the whole object inside Service Account's JSON file.
# Should look something like this:
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS=`{
